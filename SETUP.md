# TurkChan Setup Guide

Current setup and deployment guide for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Current development version: `2.2.2`.

This guide reflects the current TurkChan architecture:

- Tor onion hosting is built in via Arti. You do not install or manage a separate `tor` service.
- `ffmpeg` is optional, but strongly recommended if you want WebP thumbnails, WebM transcoding, video thumbnails, and audio waveforms.
- The post edit form and self-delete flow share a 60-second self-action window after posting.

## What TurkChan Needs

TurkChan is a single Rust binary. A basic install only needs:

- Rust toolchain to build it
- a writable runtime data directory (next to the binary by default, or selected with `--data-dir`)
- `ffmpeg` if you want the enhanced media pipeline

TurkChan does not require:

- Docker
- Postgres or MySQL
- Redis
- a separate Tor daemon

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csd113/RustChan.git
cd RustChan
cargo build --release
./target/release/rustchan-cli
```

On first launch TurkChan creates `rustchan-data/settings.toml`, `rustchan-data/logs/`, and the rest of its runtime directories next to the binary.

Then in another terminal:

```bash
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin create-admin admin "ChangeThisPasswordNow"
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin create-board b "Random" "General discussion"
```

Open:

- `http://localhost:8080`
- admin panel: `http://localhost:8080/admin`

If TLS is enabled in `settings.toml`, TurkChan also serves HTTPS on port `8443` by default.

## Install Rust

### Linux and macOS

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### Windows

Install Rust with `rustup-init.exe` from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs), then open a new PowerShell window and verify:

```powershell
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Install ffmpeg

`ffmpeg` is optional, but TurkChan is significantly better with it.

When `ffmpeg` is available, TurkChan can:

- extract video thumbnails
- generate audio waveform thumbnails
- convert supported image thumbnails to WebP
- transcode MP4 uploads to WebM when VP9 and Opus are available

Without `ffmpeg`, TurkChan still runs, but video and audio handling degrades gracefully.

### Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install -y ffmpeg
```

If your base Fedora repos do not provide the codec-enabled build you want, use RPM Fusion.

### macOS

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Windows

```powershell
winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e
```

Then make sure the FFmpeg `bin` directory is on `PATH`.

### Verify ffmpeg Exists

```bash
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

If you want TurkChan to refuse startup when `ffmpeg` is missing, set:

```toml
require_ffmpeg = true
```

## Verify WebP and WebM Support

TurkChan checks more than just whether `ffmpeg` exists. It also checks whether your build includes:

- `libwebp` for WebP image thumbnails and conversions
- `libvpx-vp9` for WebM video encoding
- `libopus` for WebM audio encoding

Use these commands:

```bash
ffmpeg -encoders | rg libwebp
ffmpeg -encoders | rg libvpx-vp9
ffmpeg -encoders | rg libopus
```

If you do not have `rg`, use:

```bash
ffmpeg -encoders | grep libwebp
ffmpeg -encoders | grep libvpx-vp9
ffmpeg -encoders | grep libopus
```

You want all three to appear.

### What Each Encoder Enables

- `libwebp`: WebP thumbnail and image conversion support
- `libvpx-vp9` + `libopus`: MP4 to WebM transcoding support

### Linux Notes

On Debian-family systems, the usual install is:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg libwebp-dev libvpx-dev libopus-dev
```

The important part is still the actual `ffmpeg -encoders` output. Package names alone do not guarantee your installed FFmpeg binary was built with every encoder enabled.

### macOS Notes

Most Homebrew FFmpeg installs are fine, but verify with:

```bash
ffmpeg -encoders | rg 'libwebp|libvpx-vp9|libopus'
```

If one is missing, reinstall FFmpeg from a build source that includes that codec set.

### Windows Notes

Use a full FFmpeg build rather than a minimal one, then verify with:

```powershell
ffmpeg -encoders | Select-String libwebp
ffmpeg -encoders | Select-String libvpx-vp9
ffmpeg -encoders | Select-String libopus
```

### What TurkChan Does If Support Is Missing

TurkChan will log warnings and continue:

- missing `libwebp`: image thumbnails stay in original-friendly formats where needed
- missing VP9 or Opus: MP4 uploads are stored as MP4 instead of transcoded to WebM

These warnings appear in the console at startup and in `rustchan-data/logs/`.

## Build and Run

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Binary:

- Linux/macOS: `target/release/rustchan-cli`
- Windows: `target/release/rustchan-cli.exe`

### Run

```bash
./target/release/rustchan-cli
```

### Optional CLI Flags

```bash
./target/release/rustchan-cli --port 9090
./target/release/rustchan-cli serve --chan-net
./target/release/rustchan-cli --data-dir /absolute/path/to/rustchan-data
```

## First-Run Files and Layout

By default TurkChan stores runtime state in `rustchan-data/` next to the binary.
Pass `--data-dir` with an absolute, non-root path to place the complete runtime
layout elsewhere. This is the supported layout for service installations; it
includes `settings.toml`, the database, uploads, logs, backups, and runtime
secrets. The selected data directory has this layout:

```text
rustchan-data/
├── settings.toml
├── chan.db
├── logs/
│   └── rustchan.YYYY-MM-DD.log
├── backups/
│   ├── full/
│   └── boards/
├── runtime/
│   ├── tls/
│   ├── tor/
│   │   ├── state/
│   │   └── cache/
│   ├── favicon/
│   └── tmp/
└── boards/

## Banner Artwork Requirements

TurkChan `1.4.0` includes board banners plus a separate home-page announcement banner.

Banner upload requirements:

- exact `468x60` aspect ratio
- minimum size `468x60`
- recommended size `936x120`
- input can be PNG, JPEG, or WebP
- TurkChan converts uploaded banner images to WebP automatically

Board banner placement:

- board index: under the board name/description, above `[Index] [Catalog] [Archive]`
- catalog: under the board name/description, above `Sort By:` and `Show OP Comment:`
- no banner on thread pages
- no banner on archive pages
- no banner on search pages

Home page banner placement:

- separate centered banner box on the home page
- intended for MOTD/news/announcement use

Banner link behavior:

- internal board and internal-path links work directly
- external links can be enabled in the admin panel
- when enabled, external banner clicks go through an on-site warning page before redirecting
```

Important notes:

- `settings.toml` is generated automatically on first run
- `cookie_secret` is generated automatically on first run
- Tor state and onion keys live under `rustchan-data/runtime/tor/state/`
- logs rotate daily under `rustchan-data/logs/`

## Important settings.toml Options

The generated file documents every setting inline. Commonly tuned settings:

```toml
forum_name = "TurkChan"
site_subtitle = "select board to proceed"
default_theme = "aurora"
enabled_builtin_themes = ["aurora"]
port = 8080

max_image_size_mb = 8
max_video_size_mb = 50
max_audio_size_mb = 150

# Longest edge a stored full-size image keeps, in pixels. A camera original is
# far larger than any screen that shows it, so it is scaled down on the way in
# while its aspect ratio is kept. Set to 0 to store images untouched.
max_image_dimension = 2560

# Upload quotas, counted per window and charged for what was actually stored.
# A per-file limit bounds one upload and says nothing about the hundred that
# follow it, so these are what actually bound a poster. Set either pair to 0 to
# switch that budget off.
# upload_quota_window = 86400
# upload_quota_account_mb = 512
# upload_quota_account_files = 200
# upload_quota_address_mb = 1024
# upload_quota_address_files = 400

enable_tor_support = true
# tor_only = false
# tor_bootstrap_timeout_secs = 120
# tor_max_concurrent_streams = 512
# tor_service_nickname = "rustchan"

require_ffmpeg = false
# ffmpeg_path = "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg"
# ffprobe_path = "/usr/local/bin/ffprobe"
ffmpeg_timeout_secs = 600

[tls]
enabled = false
require_https = false
port = 8443
# redirect_http = true
# http_port = 8080
```

### A Few High-Impact Settings

- `enable_tor_support = true`: built-in onion service is on
- `tor_only = true`: bind TurkChan to loopback and serve only through Tor
- `require_ffmpeg = true`: fail startup if ffmpeg is missing
- `[tls].enabled = true`: explicitly enable TurkChan's native HTTPS listener
- `[tls].require_https = true`: opt into disabling public plaintext application access
- `ffmpeg_timeout_secs = 600`: max runtime for a single ffmpeg job

## Tor Onion Service

TurkChan includes built-in Tor onion service hosting through Arti.

You do not need to:

- install `tor`
- write a `torrc`
- manage a hidden service directory manually

### Default Behavior

On current builds, the generated `settings.toml` enables Tor support by default:

```toml
enable_tor_support = true
```

On first startup with Tor enabled, TurkChan:

1. creates the Tor runtime directories
2. bootstraps to the Tor network
3. generates or loads the onion service keypair
4. starts serving the site over `.onion`

The first bootstrap usually takes longer than later boots because Tor directory data has to be downloaded and cached.

### Where the Onion Key Lives

Back up:

```text
rustchan-data/runtime/tor/state/
```

That directory contains the persistent onion identity. If you lose it, the next startup will generate a new onion address.

### Tor-Only Mode

If you want TurkChan reachable only through Tor:

```toml
enable_tor_support = true
tor_only = true
```

In this mode TurkChan binds to loopback instead of `0.0.0.0`, so clearnet access is blocked.

### Tor Permissions

TurkChan creates the Tor state directory with restricted permissions on Unix. If you move the data directory manually, preserve write access for the TurkChan service user.

## HTTPS and TLS

TurkChan has built-in HTTPS support.

The generated `settings.toml` currently includes:

```toml
[tls]
enabled = false
port = 8443
```

This means:

- HTTP is available on the main app port
- HTTPS support is configured but disabled until you turn it on
- when enabled, TurkChan can generate a local self-signed development certificate

## Observability Endpoints

`/healthz` is public and intentionally minimal. `/readyz` returns only a readiness status by default, and `/metrics` returns `404` unless explicitly enabled.

Only enable detailed readiness or metrics for a trusted scrape path:

```toml
public_readiness_details = true
public_metrics_enabled = true
```

Detailed readiness and metrics include operational state such as database schema health, backup freshness, media backlog, maintenance state, and Tor readiness. If you expose them, use a reverse-proxy allowlist, private network, or equivalent network boundary. Tor-facing deployments should keep the defaults unless you intentionally monitor those endpoints externally.

### Common Modes

#### Local or LAN Testing

Keep built-in TLS enabled and use the self-signed certificate.

#### Public Production Reverse Proxy

Many operators still prefer putting nginx or Caddy in front and terminating TLS there.

#### ACME / Let's Encrypt

TurkChan also supports ACME-based certificates when built with the `tls-acme` feature and configured in `[tls.acme]`.

## Linux Service Setup

Run TurkChan as a dedicated unprivileged user.

### 1. Create a Service User

```bash
sudo useradd --system --home /var/lib/rustchan --create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin rustchan
```

### 2. Build and Install the Binary

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 target/release/rustchan-cli /usr/local/bin/rustchan-cli
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/rustchan
sudo chown -R rustchan:rustchan /var/lib/rustchan
```

### 3. First Start as the Service User

This creates `settings.toml` and the runtime layout:

```bash
sudo -u rustchan -H /usr/local/bin/rustchan-cli --data-dir /var/lib/rustchan
```

Stop it after the first start, edit `/var/lib/rustchan/settings.toml`, then continue.

### 4. Create a systemd Unit

Create `/etc/systemd/system/rustchan.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=TurkChan
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
User=rustchan
Group=rustchan
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/rustchan
StateDirectory=rustchan
StateDirectoryMode=0700
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rustchan-cli --data-dir /var/lib/rustchan serve
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`StateDirectory=rustchan` asks systemd to keep `/var/lib/rustchan` writable by
the unprivileged service account. The explicit `--data-dir` keeps all runtime
state there even though the root-owned executable lives under `/usr/local/bin`.

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now rustchan
sudo journalctl -u rustchan -f
```

### 5. Optional Environment Overrides

You can add overrides with:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit rustchan
```

Example:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=CHAN_BIND=127.0.0.1:8080
Environment=CHAN_REQUIRE_FFMPEG=true
```

## Reverse Proxy Notes

If you put nginx or Caddy in front of TurkChan:

- point the proxy at the TurkChan HTTP listener
- set `CHAN_BEHIND_PROXY=true` if you want proxy headers trusted
- set `CHAN_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` to the proxy's loopback or private CIDR when the proxy is not on localhost
- decide whether TLS terminates at the proxy or inside TurkChan

When TurkChan's built-in TLS is enabled, HTTPS is an additional listener and the
main HTTP application listener remains available by default. Set
`require_https = true` under `[tls]` to opt into HTTPS-only access. Independently,
`redirect_http = true` exposes `tls.http_port` as a redirect listener instead of
serving application routes there. With the built-in Tor service enabled,
HTTPS-only mode also keeps a loopback HTTP backend that accepts only connections
registered by its in-process Tor proxy.

TurkChan accepts bounded `Content-Length` request bodies and rejects
`Transfer-Encoding` at the application boundary. Configure a reverse proxy to
dechunk request bodies before forwarding them. Request headers are limited to
32 KiB per value and 64 KiB in aggregate.

Typical loopback setup:

```text
internet -> nginx/caddy -> 127.0.0.1:8080 -> TurkChan
```

If you use a reverse proxy and terminate TLS there, make sure your proxy forwards the usual headers and that TurkChan is not accidentally exposed directly on the public interface.

## Admin Bootstrapping

Create the first admin account:

```bash
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin create-admin admin "UseAStrongPassword"
```

Create a board:

```bash
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin create-board tech "Technology" "Programming and hardware"
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin list-admins
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin list-boards
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin reset-password admin "NewStrongPassword"
```

## Updating

```bash
git pull
cargo build --release
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 target/release/rustchan-cli /usr/local/bin/rustchan-cli
sudo systemctl restart rustchan
```

Before major updates, back up:

- `rustchan-data/chan.db`
- `rustchan-data/boards/`
- `rustchan-data/runtime/tor/state/`
- `rustchan-data/settings.toml`

Or use the built-in backup tools from the admin panel.

TurkChan `1.4.1` reset the database baseline: fresh installs create the
current schema directly instead of replaying pre-release internal migrations.
A database that structurally matches a recognized baseline is marked with the
version of the release that introduced it, so `1.3.0`, `1.4.0`, `1.4.1`, and
`2.2.1` databases are all carried forward into `2.2.2` by the additive repair
path, which appends the tables, columns, indexes, and invariants the newer
release added rather than rebuilding anything. Partial, unknown, or corrupt schemas are
rejected without deleting data. Future released schema changes should add
normal forward migrations tied to TurkChan release versions.

## Troubleshooting

### The TUI shows ffmpeg warnings

Run:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg -encoders | rg 'libwebp|libvpx-vp9|libopus'
```

If one of those encoders is missing, TurkChan will still run but some media features will be downgraded.

### Tor never becomes ready

Check:

- outbound network connectivity
- whether the TurkChan service user can write to `rustchan-data/runtime/tor/`
- whether `tor_bootstrap_timeout_secs` needs to be raised

Also review:

```text
rustchan-data/logs/rustchan.YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

### HTTPS fails on startup

Check:

- whether `[tls] enabled = true` is intentional
- whether the configured HTTPS port is available
- whether your ACME or manual cert settings are correct if you use those modes

### The service starts but uploads fail

Make sure the TurkChan user can write to:

- `rustchan-data/`
- the uploads directory
- `rustchan-data/runtime/`

### The onion address changed unexpectedly

That usually means the Tor state directory was deleted, replaced, or not persisted:

```text
rustchan-data/runtime/tor/state/
```

Back that directory up if the onion address matters.
