TurkChan gives you boards, threads, replies, media uploads, moderation, backups, themes, and an admin panel without requiring a stack of services. It runs as one binary, uses bundled SQLite, and keeps its runtime files in one data directory.

Current version: `1.4.1`. Minimum supported Rust version: `1.91`.

## Quick start

You need Rust `1.91` or newer. TurkChan works without `ffmpeg`, but installing `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` enables the full media pipeline.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csd113/RustChan.git
cd RustChan
cargo build --release

./target/release/rustchan-cli admin create-admin admin "ChangeThisPasswordNow"
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin create-board b "Random" "General discussion"
./target/release/rustchan-cli admin create-board tech "Technology" "Programming and hardware"

./target/release/rustchan-cli
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The admin panel is at `http://localhost:8080/admin`.

On Windows, use `target/release/rustchan-cli.exe`. For a service installation, give TurkChan an absolute data directory such as `--data-dir /var/lib/rustchan`.

The full installation and deployment walkthrough is in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). It covers Rust and `ffmpeg` installation, systemd, reverse proxies, TLS, Tor, updates, and troubleshooting.

## Configuration

On first run, TurkChan creates `rustchan-data/` next to the executable. Pass `--data-dir /absolute/path` to put the complete runtime somewhere else. The server reads `settings.toml` from that selected directory, not from the current working directory.

```text
rustchan-data/
├── settings.toml
├── chan.db
├── logs/
├── backups/
│   ├── full/
│   └── boards/
├── runtime/
│   ├── tls/
│   ├── tor/
│   ├── favicon/
│   └── tmp/
└── boards/
```

Back up the whole directory if you want to move or recover a site.

Fresh configuration files document the available settings inline. A basic configuration looks like this:

```toml
forum_name = "TurkChan"
site_subtitle = "select board to proceed"
default_theme = "forest"
port = 8080
enable_tor_support = true
require_ffmpeg = false

[tls]
enabled = false
require_https = false
port = 8443
```

Common runtime options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--data-dir /absolute/path` | Selects the complete runtime directory |
| `--port 9090` | Overrides the main listener port |
| `enable_tor_support` | Starts the built-in Arti onion service |
| `tor_only` | Binds the application to loopback and serves it through Tor |
| `require_ffmpeg` | Fails startup if the enhanced media tools are unavailable |
| `enable_any_file_uploads_feature` | Lets individual boards opt into generic file uploads |
| `[tls].enabled` | Enables the native TLS listener |
| `auto_full_backup_interval_hours` | Sets the automatic full-backup interval |
| `backup_directory` | Optional absolute directory for all saved backups; restart to apply |

`CHAN_*` environment variables override matching configuration values. Keep `cookie_secret` stable after launch. Treat the configuration, database, backups, TLS keys, and Tor identity as private data.

### Tor and ChanNet

TurkChan can run an onion service through Arti, so it does not need a separate `tor` daemon. Its persistent onion identity is stored under `rustchan-data/runtime/tor/state/`; include that directory in backups if you want to keep the same onion address.

For a Tor-only site:

```toml
enable_tor_support = true
tor_only = true
```

ChanNet is a separate, optional listener for snapshot transfer, content polling, remote refresh, and RustWave integration. It is disabled by default and listens on `127.0.0.1:7070` unless reconfigured. If you are not using it, leave it off. If you are, keep it behind a trusted network boundary.

### Media tools

Without `ffmpeg`, TurkChan still validates and stores supported media and can create basic image thumbnails. With compatible `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` builds, it can also create video thumbnails and audio waveforms, use the enhanced WebP path, and transcode MP4 uploads to WebM when the required VP9 and Opus encoders are present.

Set `require_ffmpeg = true` if those capabilities are mandatory for your deployment.

## Administration and recovery

Most day-to-day work happens in the browser admin panel. It covers boards, access rules, media limits, reports, appeals, bans, themes, banners, favicons, storage, background jobs, backups, restores, and maintenance.

Bootstrap and shell-friendly commands include:

```text
rustchan-cli admin create-admin
rustchan-cli admin reset-password
rustchan-cli admin list-admins
rustchan-cli admin create-board
rustchan-cli admin delete-board
rustchan-cli admin list-boards
rustchan-cli admin ban
rustchan-cli admin unban
rustchan-cli admin list-bans
rustchan-cli admin db-status
```

Run `rustchan-cli admin --help` for arguments and flags.

Full-site and per-board backups can be saved on disk or downloaded. Restores accept uploaded archives and saved backups. TurkChan checks archive paths, sizes, structure, and expansion before it changes live data, but you should still keep independent copies and test your restore process.

Configure backup storage in **Admin → Backups → backup storage directory**, or set
`backup_directory = "/mnt/backup-disk/rustchan"` in `settings.toml`.
`CHAN_BACKUP_DIRECTORY` takes precedence. Omit both to retain `<data-dir>/backups/`.
Changes take effect after restarting; existing backups are never moved to the new
location. Only the active directory is listed, restored from, and pruned. Set the
path back to the displayed default to access existing default backups again.
Backup v4 folders live directly in this directory; legacy ZIPs use its `full/`
and `boards/` subdirectories. Temporary download and restore staging files still
use runtime temporary storage.

Use a dedicated directory outside live uploads and runtime state. Missing
directories are created and tested for read/write/delete access; Unix backup
directories retain mode `0700` and backup files retain their existing private
permissions. The service user must have suitable ownership/permissions, including
on NAS mounts. An invalid or inaccessible explicit path fails validation without
falling back. Mount the storage before starting TurkChan; TurkChan does not manage
mounts or verify the identity of the mounted device.

### Health and metrics

`/healthz` is a minimal public liveness check. `/readyz` only reports readiness by default, and `/metrics` returns `404` unless you enable it.

```toml
public_readiness_details = true
public_metrics_enabled = true
```

Detailed readiness and metrics can reveal database health, backup age, media queues, maintenance state, and Tor status. Restrict them at a trusted reverse proxy or network boundary.

## Security notes

TurkChan hashes client IP addresses instead of storing or logging them directly. Admin passwords use Argon2id; sessions are `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict`; state-changing forms use CSRF tokens; uploads and restores are checked before filesystem or database changes.

Those controls do not make an operator, server, proxy, or deployment trustworthy. Operators are still responsible for secrets, moderation, backups, network configuration, and local law. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the project's security policy and reporting scope.

## Development

TurkChan uses Axum, Tokio, bundled SQLite through `rusqlite`, server-rendered Rust templates, `rustls`, Arti, and an in-process worker queue.

Run the Rust checks before submitting changes:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-rust-shape.py $(git ls-files '*.rs')
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --locked --workspace --all-features
```

The first command needs no Rust toolchain. It reports a struct literal that
does not name every field of its struct, two modules re-exporting the same name
through a glob, and a path qualified further than it needs to be — the errors
the compiler otherwise reports a long way from their cause, and one at a time.

Browser regression tests use a local-only Playwright harness. Keep its configs,
package metadata, tests, fixtures, and generated artifacts in the ignored paths
listed in `.gitignore`; they are not distributed with the repository. When a
local harness is available, run focused browser checks for UI changes, including
JavaScript-disabled workflows. Media checks may require `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`.
