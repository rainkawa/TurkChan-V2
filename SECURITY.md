# TurkChan Security Policy

TurkChan accepts responsible reports about security defects in this repository.
This policy does not make the project responsible for independently operated
TurkChan instances.

## Supported versions

TurkChan does not currently publish a fixed security-support window or response
timeline. Identify the exact release, commit, and deployment configuration you
tested. Maintainers will assess the current tree and affected releases case by
case without guaranteeing remediation or release dates.

## What to report

A security report should describe a defect in TurkChan code or project-owned
configuration that can affect confidentiality, integrity, authorization, or
availability. Examples include:

- authentication, session, CSRF, authorization, or admin-boundary bypasses;
- unsafe upload, media-processing, path, archive, backup, restore, or database
  behavior;
- disclosure or replacement of credentials, database contents, private media,
  backup material, or Tor/onion-service identity keys;
- request parsing, reverse-proxy, TLS, Tor, or ChanNet defects with a concrete
  security impact;
- remote code execution, injection, traversal, cross-site scripting, or
  meaningful denial of service; and
- dependency vulnerabilities that are reachable through TurkChan's supported
  build or runtime behavior.

The following are generally not TurkChan vulnerability reports:

- operator misconfiguration, exposed admin credentials, insecure proxy rules,
  missing backups, unsafe file permissions, or unsupported modifications;
- illegal content, harassment, moderation decisions, or abuse occurring only
  on an independently operated site;
- claims that rely on a malicious operator controlling their own server; or
- general hardening suggestions without a demonstrated TurkChan defect.

Operators remain responsible for their instances, applicable law, moderation,
content, secrets, backups, Tor identity, network boundaries, and infrastructure.
TurkChan does not promise anonymity, perfect security, uninterrupted
availability, legal compliance, or protection from a malicious operator.

## Private reporting status

GitHub private vulnerability reporting is currently disabled for this
repository, and the project publishes no security email address or other
verified private inbound channel. Consequently, there is currently no safe
project-controlled way for an outside reporter to transmit sensitive
vulnerability details.

Do not open a public issue, discussion, pull request, or commit containing a
vulnerability, exploit, credentials, private keys, database contents, private
media, onion private keys, IP addresses, or identifying instance data. Preserve
the report privately and check this file and the repository Security page for a
future private channel.

**Maintainer action item:** enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting or
publish a verified private security contact, then replace this section with the
exact reporting instructions.

Once a private channel is available, include:

- the affected TurkChan version or commit;
- operating system, architecture, installation method, enabled Cargo features,
  and relevant reverse-proxy, TLS, Tor, database, media-toolchain, or ChanNet
  configuration;
- minimal, deterministic reproduction steps;
- expected behavior, actual behavior, and security impact;
- whether public posting, admin access, moderation, media, backups/restores,
  storage, Tor identity, or ChanNet is involved; and
- sanitized logs, requests, stack traces, or a minimal proof of concept.

Before transmission, remove or replace all credentials, tokens, cookies,
passwords, API keys, TLS keys, onion private keys, IP addresses, database
contents, private posts or media, hostnames, and identifying information. Use a
disposable local instance and synthetic data whenever possible. Do not probe a
site you do not own or lack permission to test.

## Public follow-up

After a report is resolved or disclosure is coordinated, a sanitized public
issue or pull request may be appropriate. Public material must not expose a
working exploit against unfixed deployments or reveal operator or user data.
Maintainers may credit reporters, publish an advisory, or request additional
validation, but this policy does not promise a particular disclosure process or
timeline.
