# Changelog

All notable changes to TurkChan will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added public account profiles with tabbed posting history, a header avatar, chosen names, self-description, and score.
- Gave administrators a board profile of their own, created on administrator creation, on sign-in, and on the first visit to their profile, so the header account menu's profile entry resolves for the default administrator. The generated row carries a hash of a value that is discarded immediately, so it identifies the operator on the board and can never be signed into.
- Generated account avatars now show the account's first letter, and a profile whose account has no uploaded picture shows that letter as a tile drawn in the page itself rather than as an image request.
- Added an account settings screen at `/account/edit`, reachable from the header account menu's "Profili Düzenle" entry, that replaces the inert placeholder link. One page carries everything an account can change about itself: the profile picture, the display name, the unique username, the profile description, and the password. The picture and the three text fields share one form, the password keeps its own form so a mistyped current password costs nothing else, and an administrator's generated profile hides the password section because that credential lives in `admin_users` rather than on the board account.
- Added account roles, their permissions, and the badge an account shows. A stored staff role (`Kullanıcı`, `Moderatör`, `Admin`, `Owner`) is the only thing that grants administration access and is the only thing an operator assigns; a trust tier derived from karma moves on its own (`User` 0-50, `Verified User` 51-100, `Angel` 101-200, `Legend` 201-450, `God` 451+); and a status sits over both, so a banned or suspended account reads as such whatever its role or karma say. Each badge is drawn in its own colour beside the account name on the profile. The role that set the site up is given the board profile it already has, so ownership is visible on the site and survives a restart, and a site that already appointed an owner keeps them.
- Made permissions granular rather than implied by a ladder. Every action names the single `Permission` it exercises, so a moderator renames and suspends but cannot replace a credential, ban, or hand out a role; an administrator does all of that but is still refused the one grant that only the owner may make; the owner keeps every permission, including any added later. Ownership cannot be given or taken by anyone else, and the site cannot be left with no owner at all.
- Added an account-management section to the administration panel at `/admin/users`, reachable from the panel's section index. It lists every account with its badge, state, and score, searches by either name, and offers exactly the controls the acting role is allowed to use: renaming, replacing the password, changing the role, suspending for a bounded time, lifting a suspension, banning, and lifting a ban. The section is reachable both by an operator session from the command line and by a board account whose role reaches the panel, and every action is written to the moderation log the same way whichever identity made it. Replacing a password or banning an account also ends the sessions that credential opened.
- Writing now belongs to accounts. A post with nobody behind it cannot be voted on, cannot be shared under a name, and cannot be found again on the profile of whoever wrote it, so a visitor with no account is refused at the door with words rather than accepted and then disconnected from everything that could answer for it. A suspended account keeps its session and can still read the site, but writing is refused in words for the reason it was suspended, and a suspended period lifts on its own when its moment passes. A banned account is told it is banned at sign-in instead of being told it mistyped its password again.
- Account sign-in is now rate limited and brute-force protected, not just the administrator sign-in. Every failed attempt is counted against both the requesting address and the name being guessed, and a run of eight failures from one address or twenty against one account is refused before any further Argon2 work is paid for. The counters are keyed by SHA-256 digest so no raw address or submitted name is held in memory, they are cleared the moment a real sign-in succeeds so nobody locks themselves out with their own typos, and expired entries are swept by the existing background task.
- Changing an account password now ends every session that account holds, including the one making the request, and signs the visitor straight back in on a session id minted after the change. A session opened with the replaced password stops working, and a value planted in the visitor's browser beforehand cannot ride across the change.
- The account settings screen now edits the short description an account publishes, so it can be written or cleared after registration rather than being fixed for life by the signup wizard. It is trimmed, bounded at the same 280 characters the wizard uses, escaped on the way out, and an account without one keeps the profile's existing "henüz bir açıklama eklememiş" line.
- Fixed the one error the anonymous-posting change left behind: the account
  link was written as an `if let ... else if let` chain, which drops the first
  scrutinee's error earlier than the next edition would, and the workspace
  denies that lint. The declined case is an ordinary branch now.
- Fixed the vote buttons never registering a vote. Each arrow is a submit button, and neither carried a `name`, so the browser sent no `value` field at all and the form arrived missing the one field that says which arrow was pressed; every press was rejected before it was read. Each button now states its own direction, and the server reads the vote already cast to tell a first press from a second one taking it back, because a press says which way a reader pushed rather than what they meant by it. This is also why the profile breakdown read zero: no vote had ever been stored.
- Posting now starts from the account's own name instead of an empty box that published every post as "Anonim", and a tick beside the name publishes a submission under a chosen name instead. The account still has to be signed in to write at all, so a chosen name is a pseudonym rather than an unattributable post: moderation, rate limiting, and the ban list all still apply to whoever wrote it. What an anonymous post gives up is the public link back — it is not listed on the profile of the account that wrote it, and its votes are nobody's to earn — and the choice comes back with a submission rejected for a captcha rather than being silently dropped.
- Added per-post upvotes and downvotes. One person holds one vote per post: the primary key is the post and the account, so a second press of the same arrow takes the vote back and a press of the other moves it, with no read-modify-write to lose a race. Voting belongs to accounts alone, so a vote always has a name behind it and the account that cast it can always take it back; a visitor without one is refused rather than counted by address, because a hashed address is a shared machine, a Tor exit, or a room with one router rather than a person. A post's score is the sum of its votes and is never stored, so it cannot drift away from the votes that produced it, and a deleted post or a deleted account takes its votes with it. The buttons are real forms, so a reader with scripting off votes the same way.
- Added a share control to every post that belongs to an account, named as `@username` and linked to that account's profile. The permalink is shown as text rather than hidden behind a button, because a board is shared by copying a line. A post that belongs to no account is shown no control at all rather than an "anonymous share" line: a share is a claim that somebody passed this on, and there is no somebody to name behind a post with no account behind it. The opening post carries the thread's share and is marked apart with its own "konu paylaşımı" label, because a thread is passed around by its first post; replies keep the same control in one quiet line. A copy button puts the absolute link on the clipboard when scripting is available and is inert without it.
- Added a secure tripcode. `Ad#gizli` still derives and shows a tripcode exactly as before — the derivation is pinned by a test, because tripcodes already written on existing posts cannot move — and `Ad##gizli` records that a password was claimed without deriving anything from it. Nothing derived from a secure secret is stored or rendered, so there is nothing to correlate across boards, nothing to crack offline, and nothing to compare two posters by. A doubled marker is read before a single one, so `Ad##gizli` asks for the secure kind rather than for a normal tripcode of `#gizli`. Secure tripcodes are drawn as a lock in the same colour as a normal one, and the name field names both markers where the tripcode is typed.
- Added an account score, shown broken down on the profile. The number is the net votes the account's own posts received, with nothing added underneath it: one upvote is one point and reads as one point, and zero means nobody has voted yet rather than that nobody has ever agreed. The votes on its opening posts and the votes on its replies are counted apart and shown apart, because a reputation built out of threads is a different kind of reputation from one built out of replies. The stored score is rewritten from the votes on every press rather than incremented, so taking a vote back moves the account back by exactly what it had gained, and a vote cannot be counted twice because the schema will not let it be written twice.
- Added upload quotas, because a per-file size limit bounds one upload and says
  nothing about the hundred that follow it. Two budgets are counted and both
  are enforced against the same submission: the signed-in account, so one
  person cannot spread an upload budget across fresh sessions, and the hashed
  client address, so a shared address — a Tor exit, a school, a room with one
  router — cannot be used to spend past a limit no single person reached. The
  two are charged or neither is, inside one transaction, so a submission that
  fits one budget and crosses the other leaves no trace on the first. What is
  charged is what was actually stored, so a conversion that shrank the file is
  not billed for the original and a deduplicated upload is billed for what it
  added rather than for the file it reused. A submission carrying no file is
  charged nothing and is never refused, so a text post is unaffected by a media
  budget, and the byte budget and the file-count budget are reported separately
  because "you have uploaded too much today" and "you have uploaded too many
  files today" are different problems. The window is fixed and aligned to the
  epoch, so every poster on the site resets at the same moment; the counters
  are one row per subject per window and are pruned once a window closes.
- Added AVIF uploads. AVIF shares the ISO base-media container with HEIC, so it
  is told apart by its declared brand rather than by a distinct header, and it
  takes the same route as HEIC: converted to WebP on the way in, because no
  browser on the site can be relied on to show it directly.

### Improved
- Stopped an image upload being kept at the size a camera produced it. A
  40-megapixel original is far larger than any screen that shows it, so it is
  scaled down on the way in to a longest edge the operator sets, keeping its
  aspect ratio. Setting the limit to 0 stores images exactly as they arrived.
- Reserved the space an image will take before it arrives. The stored pixel
  dimensions are recorded with the post and written into the page, so a
  thumbnail and an expanded image no longer push the thread down as they load.
  A post whose dimensions were never recorded declares none, which is what
  every image on the site did until now.
- Redrew the new-thread and reply forms' name field so both tripcode markers are named where they are typed, instead of leaving the secure kind to be discovered.
- Replaced the profile's join date with a "Hesap Yaşı" tile showing only the day, month, and year the account was created, and placed it beside the score in one centered row.
- Showed the header account menu on every public page: board index, thread, catalog, hidden threads, archive, and search all carry it now, not just the home page and the profile.
- Rebuilt the site header as a layered, blurred sticky bar with a brand mark, the configured subtitle, pill-shaped board chips, and a raised account button, and retired the blinking prompt that shifted every control beside it.
- Pinned the header account button to the header's top-right corner so it keeps the same position instead of sliding with header content that changes between boards and pages.

### Fixed

- Fixed a share being publishable in another account's name. The share line named
  the signed-in reader, but the name it printed was not read from the account at
  all — the reader's own name happened to be beside it, while the name printed
  on the post was whatever was typed into the form, so a post whose name field
  spelled out an existing account read as that account's post with that account's
  share under it. A share is a claim about who passed something on, and only the
  account row can support one: the name is now read from `posts.user_id` and
  resolved to the account's own login name, and a post that belongs to nobody
  — written before accounts existed, posted without signing in, or posted
  anonymously — is shown no share at all rather than a claim no person stands
  behind. Typing a name into the form can no longer produce a share, and the share
  is now part of the thread page's `ETag` so a cached body stops answering once a
  post is attributed to an account.
- Fixed there being no way from a thread to the profile of the account that shared
  it: the name in a share is now a link to that account's profile.
- Fixed two errors that stopped the crate from building, and three more of the
  same kind that the first build was not able to show. Post votes and poll
  ballots both exported a `cast_vote` through `db`, so the glob that re-exports
  each module became ambiguous; the ballot is now `cast_poll_vote`, named for
  what it votes on. Four call sites built a `RenderPostOpts` without naming the
  new `vote` and `share_by` fields: the board index, the board search results,
  the read-only post preview fetched as JSON, and the two halves of the thread
  auto-update. Rust stops type-checking a crate partway through, so the build
  reported one of the four and would have reported the rest one at a time.
- Added `scripts/check-rust-shape.py`, which reports three classes of error
  without a Rust toolchain and is now the first line of the documented
  validation sequence: a struct literal that does not name every field of its
  struct, two modules re-exporting the same name through a glob, and a path
  qualified further than it has to be. The last is judged against the module
  each use appears in, because the same path is correct in a test module that
  has not imported the module and an error in the one that has. A fourth check,
  a call passing the wrong number of arguments, was tried and dropped: it
  produced three hundred false positives against one true one. The check stays
  quiet about everything it cannot judge with certainty, because a checker that
  cries wolf teaches its reader to ignore it.
- Fixed two errors that would have stopped every existing database from opening
  at all once per-post votes shipped. The vote index was added to the baseline
  but not to the set of indexes the additive repair path is allowed to install,
  so the repair was refused as unrecognized drift and schema verification failed
  on startup; the index now belongs to that set, and the documented drift test
  drops it along with the others and proves it comes back. A database written by
  the build that keyed a vote to a hashed client address is repaired instead of
  refused: that shape is not convertible, since a hash names no account, so the
  table and its index are dropped, the empty account-keyed table is created in
  their place, and the account scores that were counted from those rows are reset
  rather than left describing votes that no longer exist. A votes table that is
  not exactly the recognized legacy shape is left alone and reported, so nothing
  is ever dropped on a guess.
- Fixed deleted posts remaining visible in a profile's post history; the listing and its tab totals now skip any post whose thread no longer exists.
- Fixed the header account button disappearing when entering a board, and stopped a cached signed-out page from being revalidated as a signed-in one by adding the account identity to the board, catalog, and thread `ETag`s.
- Fixed an uploaded profile picture never appearing. The picture was served with a one-year `immutable` cache lifetime under a URL that never changed, so the first response the browser ever saw — usually the drawn placeholder — was reused for a year and no upload was ever fetched again. Uploads are now stored under a name that carries the upload rather than only the account, the page and the settings preview link to that version, the picture route serves the file the database row actually names, and a replaced picture is deleted once the new row is committed. The drawn placeholder is derived state rather than content-addressed, so it now revalidates instead of being pinned in a cache, the stored name is checked before it is turned into a path, and the profile picture is cropped to its circle with `object-fit` instead of being squeezed into it.
- Fixed the account settings screen answering 404 on save. The profile form posts to `/account/profile` but the handler had been registered as a second method on the page route at `/account/edit`, so the action the form names was not a path the router knew. The picture, display name, username, and description now have their own route, matching the password form, and the route table and the screen each pin the other's paths so a renamed form cannot ship again.

## TurkChan 1.4.1

### Improved

- Audited implementation comments across the repository, removing generated and stale narration while retaining security, concurrency, compatibility, and operational rationale.
- Rebuilt the terminal administration console with responsive layouts, persistent navigation, selectable and scrollable data views, masked in-console and first-run credentials, contextual shortcuts, structured feedback and confirmation states, Unicode-safe clipping, and diff-based rendering.
- Hardened schema normalization with transactional legacy repairs, semantic schema-drift detection, canonical version metadata, preserved AUTOINCREMENT state, and fresh-versus-migrated equivalence checks.

### Fixed

- Reconciled persisted thread reply counters from posts during startup normalization and board restore so derived state cannot drift from its authoritative rows.

### Security

- Moved closed persisted domains and cross-row relationships into audited SQLite triggers, including boolean and enum values, bounded counters, pending-operation kinds, and post, poll, report, banner, theme, and submission relationships; malformed historical data now fails migration without stamping success.

## TurkChan 1.4.0

### Added

- Added an explicit `--data-dir` option with fail-closed validation for absolute paths, root directories, parent traversal, and symlink-resolved locations.
- Added durable ChanNet reply idempotency through optional stable message IDs and a transactional replay ledger.

### Improved

- Streamlined user preferences so changes save immediately without a redundant submit control, added clear save status, and provided equivalent immediate-action controls when JavaScript is disabled.
- Moved the public admin-login entry point from the site header to a discreet accessible footer link while preserving the existing `/admin` route and authentication flow.
- Refreshed the setup wizard with responsive step cards, clearer field guidance and validation summaries, a more structured review page, and polished authenticated setup-reopen messaging.
- Enlarged board banners and admin previews from `468x60` to `585x75` display size while preserving the supported aspect ratio, responsive scaling, and existing upload pipeline.
- Improved background-job reliability under database pressure by retrying completion persistence for the same claimed job, applying media and terminal-state updates atomically, and reconciling completed, stale, failed, and retryable work correctly during startup recovery.
- Reduced overload stalls with a bounded database-pool acquisition timeout and consistent short-retry behavior for transient SQLite and pool exhaustion.
- Improved server lifecycle handling by supervising the main HTTP, HTTPS, ACME, redirect, ChanNet, and Tor-backend listeners together and shutting peer listeners down when one exits unexpectedly.
- Improved ChanNet validation and interoperability with a legal default body envelope, Unicode scalar-value character limits, consistent JSON errors for oversized imports, and explicit exact-boundary handling.
- Refreshed all safely compatible direct and transitive Rust dependencies for Rust 1.91, including Tokio `1.53.1`, Hyper `1.11.0`, Tower HTTP `0.7.0`, Rustls `0.23.43`, Serde `1.0.229`, Clap `4.6.4`, UUID `1.24.0`, and `time` `0.3.54`; retained `rusqlite` `0.39` and `r2d2_sqlite` `0.34` as the newest pair compatible with Arti's SQLite constraint.
- Standardized Rustls, Tokio Rustls, and Rustls ACME on the Ring cryptography provider while preserving TLS 1.2, logging, ACME support, and ACME root certificates, eliminating the unused AWS-LC build toolchain from the dependency graph.
- Updated self-signed certificate validity handling for `x509-cert` `0.3.0` and adopted Tower HTTP `0.7.0` compression negotiation, including a `406 Not Acceptable` response when a client rejects every supported content coding.

### Fixed

- Fixed concurrent public thread and reply submissions reusing the same submission token so the token lookup, post creation, reply-counter update, pending filesystem operation, and canonical token mapping are committed atomically; concurrent and sequential replays now resolve to the same post without duplicate content, consumed tokens after rollback, or orphaned media.
- Fixed admin job status semantics so a healthy idle queue reports `OK` and `idle — ready`, while warnings are reserved for failed or blocked work.
- Fixed public preference cookies on plain-HTTP onion requests so their `Secure` attribute follows the actual request transport and preferences remain usable over Tor.
- Fixed upgrades with native TLS enabled so they no longer force HTTPS unexpectedly; HTTPS-only access is now an explicit opt-in through `[tls].require_https`.
- Fixed direct HTTPS session and CSRF cookies so they remain `Secure` independently of trusted-proxy compatibility settings.
- Fixed destructive saved-backup operations so delete, full restore, board restore, and board extraction all honor the shared maintenance gate and cannot race active maintenance work.
- Fixed ChanNet reply replays inserting duplicate posts and prevented view-password-protected boards from being exposed through selective exports.
- Fixed database-busy `503 Service Unavailable` responses so they include a bounded `Retry-After` header.
- Fixed `--help` and `--version` so informational CLI invocations do not initialize configuration or mutate the filesystem.
- Fixed Linux service setup instructions and runtime data placement so an unprivileged systemd service uses its configured writable data directory.
- Fixed Windows GNU target warnings caused by imports that were not guarded by the same target configuration as their call sites.

### Security

- Rejects requests containing `Transfer-Encoding`, including ambiguous `Transfer-Encoding` plus `Content-Length` framing, at the outer HTTP boundary before they can reach application handlers.
- Added conservative HTTP header limits of 32 KiB per value and 64 KiB for the parser/aggregate boundary across public and internal listeners.
- Corrected dependency auditing so CI scans `Cargo.lock` and verifies that the resolved dependency graph is non-empty instead of treating the audit policy file as a lockfile.
- Upgraded all 38 Arti/Tor crates to `0.44.0`, explicitly enabled its now-default stable congestion control, and incorporated the medium-severity TROVE-2026-24 and TROVE-2026-27 denial-of-service fixes; this raises the project MSRV to Rust 1.91.
- Upgraded the Arti/Tor stack to `0.45.0`, retaining the Rustls-only TLS configuration and explicit stable congestion-control feature.
- Updated `anyhow` to `1.0.104` and `memmap2` to `0.9.11` to resolve denied unsoundness advisories, and updated `getset` to remove the unmaintained, future-incompatible `proc-macro-error2` dependency.
- Removed the yanked `spin` `0.9.8` release while refreshing the transitive graph; the resulting lockfile contains no yanked, pre-release, or non-registry dependencies.

### Documentation

- Added TurkChan-specific community standards, contribution and support guidance,
  a security disclosure policy, pull request guidance, and structured GitHub
  issue forms with privacy-conscious reporting requirements.
- Corrected HTTPS documentation to state that TLS is disabled by default and clarified the distinction between self-signed certificate support and automatic HTTPS enablement.
- Updated deployment documentation for the explicit writable data-directory workflow.

### Internal

- Added deterministic submission-token race regressions covering shared and distinct tokens, sequential reuse, rollback and corrected retry behavior, staged-media cleanup, canonical redirects, and SQLite integrity checks across fresh disposable databases; documented the canonical replay helper for strict Quality lint compliance.
- Restored warning-clean strict Clippy coverage on the current Rust toolchain, the Rust 1.91 MSRV, and supported cross-compilation targets.
- Reduced the resolved dependency graph from 666 to 653 packages, removed stale duplicate exceptions from the dependency-audit policy, and corrected the documented rationale for Arti's RSA advisory exception.
- Added deterministic offline regressions for Arti state, cache, and native-keystore initialization, plus focused coverage for certificate validity accessors and compression negotiation.
- Replaced equivalent minute and hour duration calculations with Rust 1.91's dedicated constructors to remain warning-clean under current strict Clippy without changing timing behavior.
- Kept local browser-testing and Node/Playwright artifacts excluded from version control so they do not add repository or release-package bloat.

## TurkChan 1.3.0

### Added

- Added a guided first-run setup wizard at `/setup` with public/private/local presets, CSRF protection, review-before-write confirmation, initial admin and board creation, Tor/proxy/Secure-cookie options, CAPTCHA and activity-badge toggles, media limits, and backup defaults.
- Added admin maintenance controls to reopen or close the setup wizard later without replacing existing admin credentials.
- Added per-board PDF upload limits, setup/admin controls for enabling PDF uploads, and upload-form hints that show PDF caps separately from image, video, audio, and generic file limits.
- Added a clean `1.3.0` database baseline. Fresh databases now install the baseline directly, matching in-development databases are stamped as `1.3.0`, and partial or unknown schemas fail closed with diagnostics.
- Added schema health checks to database/admin status paths, including structural verification, SQLite quick checks, foreign-key checks, and `rustchan-cli admin db-status`.
- Added admin dashboard summaries for setup state, schema/database health, backups, storage, Tor, dependencies, background jobs, reports, and live/total thread counts.
- Added a footer copy control for the active Tor onion address.

### Improved

- Hardened upload auto-compression so processed images and videos are re-statted and revalidated before a post is finalized, with better cleanup for failed compression, poll validation failures, stale staged files, thumbnails, and partial database rows.
- Improved browser-side auto-compression reliability for extension-only or blank-MIME uploads, Chromium/WebKit video capture timeouts, submit-time guards, retry behavior, and inline compression status messages.
- Improved media validation for PDFs, ADTS AAC, WebM audio, MKV/Matroska video, small FLAC/audio files, invalid thumbnail payloads, empty upload controls, zero-byte named uploads, and cross-board media deduplication.
- Returned semantic post-upload error statuses for JS, no-JS, and XHR submissions, including `413`, `415`, and `422` where appropriate.
- Improved admin and public UI accessibility with stronger labels, IDs, ARIA attributes, inert/hidden modal states, focus behavior, report and confirmation dialogs, catalog menus, NSFW dialog behavior, theme picker behavior, media controls, and mobile form hints.
- Improved Tor/onion operation with Arti `0.43.0`, safer onion admin origin handling, clearer bootstrap/service logs, more accurate hidden-service key path reporting, and stabilized Tor restore tests.
- Improved observability defaults and documentation so `/healthz` stays public and minimal, `/readyz` hides operational details unless `public_readiness_details = true`, and `/metrics` returns `404` unless `public_metrics_enabled = true`.
- Improved upload, thread, admin, and setup tests around size limits, schema state, CSRF handling, setup reopen/close behavior, pending media refresh, and upload error classification.

### Fixed

- Fixed non-image media regressions that affected small supported audio files, valid `.mkv` uploads, `audio/webm` persistence, and audio/video MIME preservation.
- Fixed malformed ADTS AAC acceptance so invalid AAC is rejected before storage or background media jobs are created.
- Fixed PDF limit edge cases so files exactly at the configured cap are accepted while cap-plus-one uploads are rejected.
- Fixed no-JS and pending-media regressions: Firefox no-JS theme changes persist through safe local redirects, and thread update controls expose a stable `data-action="fetch-updates"` hook for pending-media refreshes.
- Fixed YouTube embed thumbnail sizing.
- Fixed legacy `1.3.0` schema drift handling on startup for in-development databases.
- Fixed unintended manual textarea resize handles on TurkChan forms.
- Updated admin login button copy.

### Security

- Required CSRF validation for theme changes and board backup actions.
- Made detailed readiness data and unauthenticated Prometheus metrics opt-in to avoid exposing operational internals on internet or onion deployments by default.
- Kept setup password handling from echoing raw admin passwords during review by using a short-lived pending hash token.
- Pinned `rustls-webpki` to a patched release for RUSTSEC-2026-0049 and refreshed the dependency lockfile.

### Documentation

- Updated `README.md` and `SETUP.md` for TurkChan `1.3.0`, the new schema baseline, `db-status`, PDF upload limits, setup behavior, and observability endpoint defaults.
- Added a static ChanNet security audit record for future follow-up.
- Refreshed release documentation and current-version references.

### Internal

- Updated Rust dependencies, including Arti/Tor crates, `sha3`, `zip`, `toml`, `tokio`, `axum`, `rustls`, and related lockfile entries.
- Renamed the saved-backup implementation module for clearer ownership.
- Cleaned focused Clippy warnings and kept strict lint coverage passing during the release cycle.

## TurkChan 1.2.2

- Replaced browser proof-of-work posting CAPTCHA with server-generated image CAPTCHA challenges.
- Improved secure-cookie handling across HTTP, HTTPS, trusted-proxy HTTPS, admin sessions, board access cookies, CSRF cookies, and owned-post cookies.
- Added no-JS fallbacks and accessibility polish for posting, reporting, catalog actions, board preferences, moderation controls, and own-post edit/delete flows.
- Hardened upload handling for empty file controls, zero-byte named uploads, empty thumbnail payloads, invalid media, and cross-board media deduplication.
- Improved activity badge cache behavior, especially on mobile WebKit and browser back/forward navigation.
- Hardened settings validation so invalid config values fail closed instead of silently falling back.
- Polished responsive layout, long-content wrapping, modal focus behavior, ESC handling, touch targets, and light-theme error contrast.
- Updated backup UI metadata handling and dynamic split-part options.
- Refreshed README screenshots and release documentation.

## [1.2.1]

### Improved

- Full-site restore now accepts Backup v4 transfer ZIPs by converting the transfer layout into the legacy restore archive shape before running the normal restore flow.
- VP9/WebM transcoding now forces yuv420p output with explicit BT.709 color metadata, avoiding inherited source color tags that can make browser playback look wrong.
- Admin site-health job post ID parsing and logging test helpers were tightened up for stricter lint compliance.
- Local JavaScript test artifacts and runtime folders are now ignored by git.

### Fixed

- New board creation now validates short names instead of silently stripping invalid characters, and duplicate board shorts return a conflict instead of proceeding into creation.
- No-JavaScript post form rendering now keeps the post form visible when scripts are unavailable.
- Random token generation keeps its fail-closed behavior while documenting the intentional process exit for Clippy.
- Rust dependency lockfile entries were refreshed for the `1.2.1` cycle.

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- The bundled banner builder in `docs/rustchan-banner-maker.html` has been rebuilt into a layered editor with stacked image uploads, per-layer controls, drag-and-resize handles, live preview, and export tools for both supported banner sizes.
- The admin panel now ships with its own dedicated `admin.css` and `admin.js` assets instead of leaning on the shared site bundle.
- HEIC and HEIF image uploads are now accepted by the media pipeline, including MIME detection, thumbnail generation, backup metadata, form copy, and documentation updates.
- Boards can now enforce their own upload size limits for images, video, and audio, with caps that stay within the site-wide maxima.
- Two new built-in themes, Blue Sky and Deep Orbit, are available across normal pages, admin views, theme seeding, defaults, and setup documentation.
- Users can now self-delete their own posts within a 60-second grace window after posting, with server-side expiry checks and UI countdown hints.
- Site-health background job details now include post IDs and direct post links when a queued, completed, or failed job can be traced back to a post.

### Improved

- The admin panel has been split into clearer sections and subsections, making board setup, moderation, settings, backups, and banner management easier to scan and work through on both desktop and mobile.
- Recent site-health job detail panels can now be closed directly after reviewing failed or completed background jobs.
- Banner editing in the admin UI is smoother: target pickers behave more predictably, external-link warnings show up inline before save, and the banner forms are laid out more cleanly.
- The board appearance editor now shows each board's NSFW tag state directly in the appearance card.
- Admin login and banner-serving internals were tightened up, with cleaner helper paths for session handling, banner access checks, and post-query lookups.
- Site settings now preserve the badge toggles more reliably when saving banner-only changes, avoiding accidental resets on partial submits.
- Backup and restore actions now use a more consistent redirect path, which keeps the progress modal and post-restore navigation on the rails after full-site and board restore requests.
- Thread rendering and post state handling are more resilient around post lookups, moderation actions, pending filesystem cleanup, media storage, worker updates, and console board setup.
- The post edit form and self-delete flow now surface the shared 60-second self-action window more clearly.
- Post rendering now sanitizes formatting more consistently and poll submission validation is stricter on both server-rendered and live-updated pages.
- Media rendering now prefers recorded MIME type information over filename guessing, improving how attached media is displayed in thread views.
- Banner exports from the standalone editor no longer include editing guide overlays, and the export flow better matches the screenshots and README examples.
- Tor bootstrap and runtime logs are humanized into clearer status messages so operators can understand connection progress without reading raw Arti output, and repeat onion-service retry spam is suppressed.
- Site stats now account for archived thread media more accurately, so admin totals reflect active content instead of counting archived bytes.
- Built-in self-signed TLS is now gated behind an explicit feature flag, keeping production builds slimmer unless the development certificate path is needed.
- Rust dependencies, GitHub Actions release tooling, and lockfile contents were refreshed for the `1.2.0` cycle.
- Release artifacts now focus on current Apple Silicon macOS builds instead of publishing a separate macOS x86 archive.
- Blue Sky and Deep Orbit theme palettes were refined for better contrast and fuller coverage across normal and admin surfaces.

### Fixed

- Restore uploads and backup actions in the admin panel now resolve their redirect targets more reliably, including cases where the browser only exposes the final response URL or HTML fallback.
- Protected board banner assets and external-banner warning routes now fail with the right `404` and `403` responses instead of falling through to less helpful error paths.
- Banner rotation now advances correctly on refresh, GIF banners keep a reliable fallback path, and animated WebP banners preserve animation instead of being flattened during processing.
- Banner upload, restore, and route handling have stronger validation and regression coverage for protected assets, board inheritance, catalog/thread placement, and warning redirects.
- Post form fields now line up more cleanly with the surrounding form layout.
- Quote references and delete-reference cleanup now stay more consistent when posts or threads are updated.
- Board access redirects now harden `return_to` handling so unlock flows cannot bounce users to unsafe destinations.
- Thumbnail fallback controls are visible when generated thumbnails are unavailable, and catalog embeds can now use absolute thumbnail URLs.

### Documentation

- `README.md`, `SETUP.md`, and the release notes were cleaned up for the `1.2.0` cycle, with plainer wording and less filler.
- The README was rewritten for clearer structure and refreshed with banner-maker screenshots and current feature wording.

### Internal

- Removed dead code, unused API paths, and stale helper branches that were no longer part of the live request flow.
- Admin backup, settings, board, posting, and thread handlers were split into smaller modules, with focused regression coverage for posting flows, restore redirects, banner behavior, board redirects, and live thread updates.
- The ffprobe probe test now uses a symlinked binary path to verify explicit tool resolution more faithfully on Unix-like systems.
- Clippy warnings were cleaned up across the refactored modules, theme code, logging, storage, templates, and banner handling to keep strict lint compliance.
- Comments and documentation were trimmed to remove leftover AI-generated phrasing and stale implementation notes.

## [1.1.4]

### Added

- Full banner management in the admin panel: operators can upload, preview, reorder, edit, and delete global board banners, per-board banner overrides, and a separate home-page MOTD/news banner.
- Global board-banner rotation with two modes: rotate on each refresh by default, or enforce a site-wide time-based rotation interval in minutes.
- Per-board banner behavior modes that mirror the favicon-style override model: each board can inherit the global banner pool, disable banners entirely, or use one fixed board-specific override.
- Clickable banner destinations for internal boards and internal paths, plus optional external banner links guarded by an on-site warning/interstitial page before redirecting users away from TurkChan.
- The admin quick-create board form now includes an audio-upload toggle, so new boards can be created with audio enabled directly from the UI instead of only through later edits or the CLI.

### Improved

- Board-page presentation is more intentional: centered banners now render under the board title/description, above the board nav on index pages, and above catalog controls on catalog pages.
- Home page announcement tooling is stronger through a dedicated banner box that is separate from board-header banners and suitable for MOTD, maintenance, or news updates.
- Banner uploads now follow TurkChan's media pipeline expectations by validating the exact `468x60` aspect ratio, documenting a minimum `468x60` / recommended `936x120` workflow, and normalizing uploads to WebP.
- Full-site and board-level restore compatibility now covers the new banner metadata and asset layout so banner configuration survives backup workflows.

### Documentation

- `README.md` and `SETUP.md` now document the new banner system, placement rules, link behavior, and the exact artwork requirements for banner uploads.

## [1.1.3]

### Added

- Automated saved full-site backups with admin-configurable cadence and retention: the full backup panel and `settings.toml` now expose how many hours to wait between runs and how many saved full backups to keep, with automated runs pruning the oldest saved full backups after each new server-side full backup completes.
- Per-board password protection with two modes: boards can now require a password to view the board at all or stay publicly readable while requiring the board password for posting, with admin controls for saving/clearing board passwords, unlock flows for users, and server-side enforcement across board pages, thread views, replies, edits, votes, media, and post-preview endpoints.

### Improved

- Homepage board cards and board catalog thread cards now keep a more consistent square visual rhythm: the main content rail is wider on desktop, homepage NSFW badges sit beside board IDs for faster scanning, and catalog size toggles once again distinguish compact and large thread cards while preserving more uniform tile heights.
- HTTP timeout handling is now more robust across the full request pipeline: `GET` and `HEAD` requests keep the fast 30-second cutoff, while slower write paths such as uploads, restores, and admin `POST`s are now covered by a longer request timeout instead of bypassing timeout protection entirely.
- Proxy-aware HTTPS detection is now stricter and operator-configurable: `X-Forwarded-*` headers are trusted only from explicitly allowed proxy CIDRs, with loopback remaining the safe default.
- Admin session cookie issuance is now wired through real connection metadata on login and restore flows, eliminating header-only protocol trust and keeping direct-access and proxied deployments aligned.
- HTTP to HTTPS redirects are now more robust on manual-certificate deployments bound to wildcard addresses, with explicit public-host configuration for production domains that are not discoverable from the local bind address.
- The shared site footer now stays pinned to the bottom of the viewport through a dedicated fixed-footer layout, while preserving the original homepage card grid and overall 1.1.2-style page flow.
- Theme CSS internals are cleaner and safer to maintain: the fixed footer now uses one shared height variable with safe-area-aware body padding, Frutiger Aero and NeonCubicle now share one glass-pill navigation implementation, and the Forest theme now centralizes repeated surface, link, button, and input colors behind theme-scoped variables.
- Mobile header polish is tighter on board pages: the search bar now stretches to the same visual rails as the Home and Boards controls instead of ending short on narrow screens.
- The theme picker now lives in a footer-docked control bar on both desktop and mobile, giving theme switching one consistent home and keeping it from floating over page content.
- Backup and media-processing observability are stronger: posts now expose pending and failed async media state, opt-in detailed `/readyz` and `/metrics` report media backlog, backup freshness, and maintenance activity, and the admin panel surfaces backup verification health instead of assuming saved ZIPs are restorable.
- Public observability is safer by default for internet and onion deployments: `/healthz` remains public, `/readyz` exposes only readiness status unless `public_readiness_details = true`, and `/metrics` is disabled unless `public_metrics_enabled = true`.
- Heavy admin maintenance now coordinates through a shared maintenance gate and less aggressive background scheduling, so backups, restores, integrity checks, repair, and scheduled `VACUUM`/WAL work are less likely to pile onto live request traffic or each other.
- Full backup recovery is now more flexible without adding scheduler clutter: new full backups record the boards they contain, and the admin panel can derive a single-board restore or downloadable board backup directly from a saved full-site archive.
- Long media filenames now keep post layouts tidier without hiding the real upload name: thread and reply views truncate only the displayed stem, preserve the extension in the visible link text, and still expose the full original filename through the link tooltip.
- Upload-backed posting and admin restore flows now use explicit XHR redirect/error responses instead of scraping returned HTML, so media uploads fail in-place with clearer feedback and restore uploads stay inside the existing progress modal without fragile document replacement.
- Thread pages now separate board-level navigation from thread-specific actions more cleanly: board links live in the shared board-nav strip, reply/update controls stay in the thread nav, and the admin toolbar sits under the board context instead of leading the page.
- Admin board management is now organized around distinct tasks instead of one dense block: each board card separates basic setup, access controls, post features, appearance, backups, and destructive actions, while the full-site and board-backup areas now split scheduling, immediate restore/create actions, and saved archives into clearer sections.
- Handled XHR validation and restore failures are now transported without browser-level network noise: inline upload and restore errors return structured JSON that preserves the original semantic status in `X-Rustchan-Error-Status`, letting TurkChan keep the same in-place error UX without Chromium surfacing expected invalid-request checks as console `Failed to load resource` errors.
- The admin panel now better preserves operator context during repeated maintenance work: backup/archive dropdowns remember their open state, board/settings forms restore more of their previous inputs after validation failures, and moderation copy/actions are more compact and easier to scan.
- The terminal dashboard now surfaces active FFmpeg video jobs directly in the TUI, making it easier to spot live transcode backlog without leaving the server console.
- VP9 transcode settings are now auto-tuned per host architecture and CPU capability: TurkChan picks more appropriate `libvpx-vp9` threading, tiling, and `cpu-used` settings on AVX512, AVX2, AVX, SSE4.1, ARM, and generic targets instead of using one static profile everywhere.
- Release engineering is more automated and portable: tagged builds now publish GitHub Releases through Actions, attach per-platform ZIP archives with bundled `README`/`LICENSE`, and generate verified `SHA256SUMS` manifests for release downloads.
- CI and release automation now track newer dependency and action versions, including the move to `reqwest 0.13`, newer `rustls-acme`, refreshed Windows support crates, and updated GitHub Actions checkout/artifact/release steps.

### Fixed

- Per-board password protection now fails closed more reliably: invalid or partial access-mode data from backups is rejected or forced into a locked state instead of silently becoming public, password-gated pages now return consistent `403`/`429` responses with no-cache headers, and repeated board-unlock failures are temporarily throttled to make online guessing harder.
- Requests coming directly from untrusted public peers can no longer spoof `X-Forwarded-Proto` to make the app believe they arrived over HTTPS.
- Built-in self-signed TLS recovery is now resilient to partially missing or corrupted dev-cert files: if the stored cert/key pair cannot be reused, TurkChan regenerates a fresh pair instead of failing startup outright.
- Timeout coverage no longer leaves upload-heavy and admin mutation endpoints outside the request-timeout middleware.
- Mobile layout resilience is stronger across the updated style system: the header board menu now follows the real wrapped header height instead of a fixed offset, admin board-settings forms collapse cleanly to one column on narrow screens, and wide admin tables stay usable on phones through horizontal scrolling.
- The admin panel is now substantially more mobile-friendly: dropdown headings wrap instead of running offscreen, board action controls stack cleanly on narrow screens, create-board and moderation forms fit the viewport, and the heaviest admin tables no longer force excessive horizontal overflow.
- Admin login is now more robust on plain `http://` deployments and local-network mobile access: insecure login redirects can recover through a short-lived bootstrap handoff instead of failing when the browser drops the freshly issued admin session cookie before `/admin/panel` loads.
- Admin login no longer fails with a `403` after the CSS refactor on plain `http://` deployments: the login page now reissues its CSRF cookie using the real request scheme so browsers do not drop the cookie before `/admin/login` is processed.
- Mobile media expansion behaves more predictably: tapping a video thumbnail now keeps playback inline on the page instead of collapsing back or jumping toward fullscreen, the filename remains the explicit open-in-new-tab path for fullscreen viewing, and image/video close buttons now use a smaller control footprint.
- Mobile image and video viewing now matches desktop more closely: the old floating media viewer has been removed, images and videos expand inline on the page with the same close-button flow as desktop, and the blue double-arrow/expand overlay is no longer shown over media on touch layouts.
- Desktop and mobile audio MiniPlayers now use the attached post image as album art for image+audio combo posts, while audio-only posts continue falling back to the current favicon artwork.
- Duplicate threads and replies are now prevented on unstable connections: post forms carry a per-render submission token, successful submissions are recorded server-side, and a retried POST now redirects back to the already-created post instead of inserting a second copy when the first response was lost in transit.
- Board search no longer fails when the FTS join exposes duplicate column names, and search queries are now normalized consistently so lowercase searches such as `ai` also match uppercase post text like `AI`.
- Background media processing now degrades more honestly under pressure: queue-capacity drops and permanent worker failures are persisted onto the post, failed previews fall back to the original file link, and operators can see pending and failed media work instead of silently missing thumbnails or waveforms.
- Saved backups are now verified before they are exposed as healthy: full backups include a manifest and SQLite-header checks, board backups are validated before save and in the admin listing, and backup freshness/verification status is now visible in both the admin UI and readiness metrics.
- Admin backup progress polling no longer conflicts with the maintenance lock during an active backup or restore, and failed backup builds now clean up temporary artifacts instead of leaving behind stale `.tmp` ZIPs or database snapshots.
- Saved full backups are now easier to work with on desktop and mobile: backup table actions stack more cleanly, per-row board extraction stays collapsed until needed, and older full backups without the new board index can still be extracted by entering a board short name manually.
- Startup schema housekeeping no longer runs indexes ahead of pending migrations, and the legacy `posts.ip_hash` table rebuild now preserves `media_processing_state` and `media_processing_error` so upgraded installs keep async media-status data intact instead of silently dropping those columns.
- Mobile thread and archive views now stay readable on narrow screens: reply cards use the full available width again, thread action rows wrap and center cleanly, archive rows break metadata onto separate lines, and two-column board/catalog tiles can shrink without forcing horizontal squeeze.
- Board restore now preserves original post IDs when they are still available, and when collisions force new IDs TurkChan remaps same-board quotelinks in restored post bodies and rendered HTML so restored conversations keep their internal reply links intact.
- Auto-saved quote-only reply drafts no longer come back as stale `>>123` stubs when you reopen the reply form; only real in-progress text drafts keep persisting between visits.
- Upload-backed post failures no longer fall back to blocking browser alerts, and media-backed ban hits now redirect to a dedicated ban page so the appeal flow still works without relying on brittle in-place HTML swaps.
- The recent admin and thread polish pass no longer strands shared JavaScript helpers inside the media auto-compress scope: `createAsyncSubmitHelper`, `requestConfirmation`, and the shared confirmation-submit helpers are once again available to reply uploads, full backup creation, restore uploads, and `data-confirm` actions, restoring inline `.post-error-banner` feedback, confirmation-modal focus/escape/backdrop behavior, the full backup/restore progress flows on live pages, and the compact `[ Return ] [ Catalog ] [ Top/Bottom ] [ Update ] [ Auto ]` thread navigation bars.
- HSTS emission is now correct for trusted proxy hosts as well as direct connections, avoiding missing strict-transport headers on deployments that terminate TLS upstream.
- Media post refreshes and moderation report actions now stay in sync on live pages: freshly processed media state is re-rendered more reliably, duplicate report submissions are blocked, and same-thread upload redirects reset reply form state before repopulating it.

### Documentation

- The `README` was refreshed for the `1.1.3` release with clearer wording and updated screenshots/layout so new installs and release downloads better match the current UI.

### Internal

- Upload-flow tests now use temporary directories for better isolation, the FFmpeg VP9 test coverage stays Clippy-clean, and several unused helpers/duplicate form structs were removed to keep the `1.1.3` codebase leaner.

## [1.1.2]

### Added

- Shared board ordering controls, backed by a persistent `display_order` field, so admins can reorder boards once and see the same order reflected across the homepage, top header board list, and admin panel.
- Live upload progress bars for post media uploads and admin restore uploads, covering image/video/audio post forms plus full-site and per-board backup restore uploads from local files.
- Modular theme infrastructure backed by a runtime theme registry, database-managed theme records, dynamic `/theme-css/{theme}` delivery, and board-level default theme support so built-in and custom themes can be managed through one system.
- Admin theme management for enabling and disabling built-in themes, creating custom themes, editing custom theme metadata and CSS, deleting custom themes, and choosing both site-wide and per-board default themes.

### Improved

- Runtime data layout is now tidier under `rustchan-data/`, with backups grouped into `backups/full` and `backups/boards`, and generated operational state grouped under `runtime/` for Tor, TLS, favicon assets, and temporary admin files.
- Homepage admin board reordering is now available through a subtler per-card toggle instead of always-visible controls, keeping the feature accessible without cluttering the board list.
- Board navigation and admin ordering now split SFW and NSFW boards into separate groups, with independent per-group move controls and safer reordering when a board is retagged between normal and NSFW.
- Post headers now render subjects inline ahead of poster names, with theme-appropriate subject colors and separators so titles remain distinct from usernames across Terminal, DORFic, ChanClassic, Frutiger Aero, FluoroGrid, and NeonCubicle.
- Theme presentation is more polished through reordered theme-picker menus, softer ChanClassic header link contrast, and rounder shared controls in Frutiger Aero and NeonCubicle so top-level navigation matches those themes' bubbly styling better.
- Theme resolution, rendering, and picker behavior are now centralized around the live theme registry, so normal pages, admin pages, ban pages, JS bootstrap, no-JS fallbacks, startup seeding, and runtime cache refreshes all follow the same precedence rules.
- Theme picker and admin theme controls are now fully data-driven, so adding, renaming, disabling, or reordering themes no longer requires parallel hardcoded edits across Rust templates, handlers, and client JavaScript.
- Theme-related admin and test internals are leaner through one shared admin dashboard snapshot loader, one shared live-theme synchronization path, a unified CSS response path for built-in and custom themes, shared CSRF jar-check handling, and a reusable `Board` test fixture.
- Admin theme management is cleaner and easier to use through a redesigned themes panel layout, separate built-in and custom theme sections, clearer built-in/custom editing affordances, and a documented custom-theme starter scaffold that explains TurkChan's scoped theme variables and common override selectors.
- Catalog page presentation is cleaner through centered sort/display selectors and larger board-description text on both board headers and homepage board cards.
- The admin site-settings layout is tidier, with the save button aligned into the form action row instead of floating awkwardly above the global favicon controls.
- Database maintenance is more user-friendly through a clearer integrity/repair results page and deeper admin repair tooling that now rebuilds SQLite indexes plus the `posts_fts` search table and triggers instead of only reporting a bare integrity status.

### Fixed

- Existing installs now migrate old runtime folders automatically at startup, so prior `full-backups`, `board-backups`, `arti_state`, `arti_cache`, `tls`, `favicon`, and temp backup-download directories continue working under the new layout without manual moves.
- Backup, Tor, TLS, favicon, admin UI, and documentation paths now consistently point at the reorganized filesystem structure instead of the older scattered folder names.
- Admin-panel live access addresses now wrap correctly on mobile instead of overflowing offscreen, and the console live-log renderer now avoids panic-prone slicing flagged by strict Clippy.
- The long-greentext collapse toggle now works as a true per-board setting instead of a global site-wide flag, with migration/backfill support for existing installs and backup/restore compatibility for the new board field.
- Client-side auto-compress is safer for oversized media: animated images are no longer silently flattened, transparent images avoid destructive JPEG fallback when the browser cannot preserve alpha, and video re-encoding now has stronger cleanup and timeout handling so the modal is less likely to get stuck.
- Board search no longer crashes on punctuation-heavy input such as `'`, `"`, or `>>1`; the search layer now normalizes free-form input into FTS-safe terms and returns ordinary empty results when nothing usable remains.
- Spoilers on legacy posts now keep working under the stricter CSP by upgrading older inline-click spoiler markup to the shared delegated `data-action` handler at runtime.
- Board backup restore now preserves archived-thread state, so threads that were already in a board archive stay archived after restore instead of being pulled back onto the live board index.
- Admin board delete and board restore now surface SQLite corruption failures more clearly, and the new integrity/repair tools are wired into the admin maintenance flow to help diagnose FTS/index corruption before destructive operations.
- Theme validation drift is eliminated: duplicated hardcoded theme lists, mismatched validators, and stale per-layer defaults were replaced with registry-backed validation and one canonical fallback path.
- Renaming or deleting custom themes now updates dependent site and board defaults safely instead of leaving stale references behind, and saved cookie or localStorage themes now fall back cleanly when a theme is disabled or removed.

## [1.1.1]

### Added

- Mobile-only board picker in the header, homepage NSFW consent overlay flow, and a no-JS theme fallback for slower or restricted browsers.
- Server-backed theme switching with explicit `return_to` routing and better backup/restore diagnostics across admin upload paths.
- Restore route request logging, board backup manifest inspection logs, and larger multipart restore coverage in the route test harness.
- Per-board archived-thread retention limit in the admin panel, with a default cap of `150` archived threads per board.
- Automatic favicon generation from a single `512x512` upload, with global site icons plus optional per-board favicon overrides.

### Improved

- Mobile interaction quality for reply, media expansion, archive rows, catalog controls, board descriptions, and header layout without changing the desktop interface.
- Poster ID chips on boards with IDs enabled now use stronger per-ID color separation so different posters are easier to tell apart without breaking theme compatibility.
- NSFW disclaimer copy and action-button styling now read more clearly across themes, including light-theme contrast improvements for the consent button.
- Audio posting UX now leads with an audio-first upload flow, clearer field labels, and an explicit optional cover-image slot instead of the previous mixed primary/secondary upload wording.
- Tor and mobile resilience through safer identity bucketing, less brittle theme persistence, JS-degraded fallbacks, and better cache revalidation for board, catalog, and thread pages.
- Generated `settings.toml` readability by regrouping settings into clearer related sections, and log organization by moving runtime logs into `rustchan-data/logs/`.
- Backup and restore internals by deduplicating board restore into one shared core and full-site restore into one shared execution path with rollback-aware filesystem swaps.
- Automatic archive trimming now deletes media only after the last remaining post reference is gone, so deduplicated uploads shared across multiple threads are preserved safely until truly unused.
- Admin favicon controls now use a compact inline layout with live previews and clearer replace/clear actions for both global and board-specific icons.

### Fixed

- Mobile photo uploads now preserve correct orientation for both stored images and generated thumbnails.
- Admin archive, pin, thread deletion, board restore, and full restore flows now refresh more reliably without requiring manual cookie or cache clearing.
- Firefox and localhost admin restore uploads no longer fail on `Origin: null` or loopback host alias mismatches when valid session and CSRF state are present.
- Linked image+audio posts now render as one combined media block, use the uploaded image as the audio thumbnail, autoplay the attached song when the image is expanded, keep playing when the image is collapsed, and size the audio seek bar to the same width as the linked image.
- Secondary combo-audio uploads now preserve FLAC bytes as-is without FFmpeg re-encoding, while still reusing the linked image thumbnail for the post presentation.
- Theme picker, board menu, catalog sort controls, and top-bar alignment no longer overflow or misplace themselves on mobile and Tor Browser.
- Thumbnail hover and click hitboxes no longer stretch left of the visible image after closing expanded media.
- OP quotelinks now render the `(OP)` marker with tighter spacing so they display as `>>123 (OP)` instead of looking over-separated.
- Backup/restore logging now respects the app’s actual tracing targets instead of being silently filtered out.
- Board index, catalog, and thread tab titles now use clearer board-aware formatting, and full-site restore no longer wipes the current global favicon when restoring an older backup that did not include favicon data.

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- ChanNet API for federation and RustWave gateway commands on port `7070`.
- Full-screen operator dashboard with live stats, logs, boards, shortcuts, and setup flows.
- Native HTTPS support with self-signed and Let's Encrypt options, plus optional HTTP to HTTPS redirects and HSTS.
- Stronger Tor support with per-stream isolation, Tor-only mode, better startup and shutdown handling, and `Onion-Location`.
- Optional arbitrary file uploads with safe download-only handling for non-media files.

### Improved

- Faster board search, batched thread previews, cached thread updates, and lower job-queue overhead.
- Safer posting, polling, replies, restores, uploads, and ChanNet imports through better transactions and rollback handling.
- Cleaner internals across server, admin, backup, middleware, media, and schema code, with a new in-memory route test harness.
- Better operator tooling with `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `X-Request-ID`, cleaner logs, and more reliable FFmpeg and bind-address handling.

### Fixed

- Proxy-aware IP handling now blocks spoofed `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For` values from untrusted clients.
- Rate limiting now covers more write and preview paths, closing easy abuse and DoS gaps.
- HTTPS deployments now enforce secure cookies, safer redirects, and more consistent HSTS behavior.
- Restore, upload, temp-file, and background-job edge cases were cleaned up to avoid partial state, stuck jobs, and unsafe paths.
- Admin feedback, upload-disabled UI, error messages, and login logging are now more consistent and safer.

### Security

- Restore validation, upload serving, backup handling, and appeal flows were tightened to reduce traversal, duplication, and data-leak risks.
- `Onion-Location`, CAPTCHA wording, and HTTPS documentation now match real runtime behavior.

### Breaking Changes

- HTTP to HTTPS redirects now use configured and trusted hosts instead of echoing arbitrary `Host` headers.

## [1.0.13] — 2026-03-08

### Improved

- Tuned SQLite connection settings by increasing `cache_size` from `-4096` to `-32000` while keeping WAL mode and `synchronous=NORMAL`.
- Added missing indexes for `posts(thread_id)` and `posts(ip_hash)`, then switched hot repeated queries to cached prepared statements.
- Returned inserted thread and post IDs with `INSERT ... RETURNING`, and kept prune/archive work batched inside transactions.
- Added maintenance and throughput safeguards: scheduled VACUUM, expired-poll cleanup, database-size warnings, job-queue back-pressure, duplicate media-job coalescing, configurable FFmpeg timeouts, archive-before-prune behavior, waveform cache eviction, streaming multipart handling, conditional GETs, compression, blocking-pool sizing, and JPEG EXIF orientation correction.

### ✨ Added
- **Backup system rewritten to stream instead of buffering in RAM** — all backup operations previously loaded entire zip files into memory, risking OOM on large instances. Downloads now stream from disk in 64 KiB chunks (browsers also get a proper progress bar). Backup creation now writes directly to disk via temp files with atomic rename on success, so partial backups never appear in the saved list. Individual file archiving now streams through an 8 KiB buffer instead of reading each file fully into memory. Peak RAM usage dropped from "entire backup size" to roughly 64 KiB regardless of instance size.
- **ChanClassic theme** — a new theme that mimics the classic 4chan aesthetic: light tan/beige background, maroon/red accents, blue post-number links, and the iconic post block styling. Available in the theme picker alongside existing themes.
- **Default theme in settings.toml** — the generated `settings.toml` now includes a `default_theme` field so the server-side default theme can be set before first startup, without requiring admin panel access.
- **Home page subtitle in settings.toml** — `site_subtitle` is now present in the generated `settings.toml` directly below `forum_name`, allowing the home page subtitle to be configured at install time.
- **Default theme selector in admin panel** — the Site Settings section now includes a dropdown to set the site-wide default theme served to new visitors.

### 🔄 Changed
- **Admin panel reorganized** — sections are now ordered: Site Settings → Boards → Moderation Log → Report Inbox → Moderation (ban appeals, active bans, word filters consolidated) → Full Site Backup & Restore → Board Backup & Restore → Database Maintenance → Active Onion Address. Code order matches page order for easier future editing.
- **"Backup & Restore" renamed** to **"Full Site Backup & Restore"** to clearly distinguish it from the board-level backup section.
- **Ban appeals, active bans, and word filters** condensed into a single **Moderation** panel with clearly labelled subsections.

---

## [1.0.12] — 2026-03-07

### 🔄 Changed
- **Database module fixes** — `threads.rs`: added explicit `ROLLBACK` on failed `COMMIT` to prevent dirty transaction state. `mod.rs`: added `sort_unstable` + `dedup` to `paths_safe_to_delete` to eliminate duplicate path entries. `mod.rs`: added `media_type` and `edited_at` columns to the base `CREATE TABLE posts` schema to match the final migrated state. `admin.rs`: replaced inlined Post row mapper with shared `super::posts::map_post` to eliminate duplication. `admin.rs`: clarified `run_wal_checkpoint` doc comment on return tuple order.
- **Template module fixes** — `board.rs`: fixed archive thumbnail path prefix from `/static/` to `/boards/`. `board.rs`: moved `fmt_ts` to the top-level import, removed redundant local `use` inside `archive_page`. `thread.rs`: corrected misleading comment about embed and draft script loading. `thread.rs`: added doc comment documenting the `body_html` trust precondition on `render_post`. `forms.rs`: removed dead `captcha_js` variable and no-op string concatenation.
- **CSS cleanup** — removed 11 dead rules for classes never emitted by templates or JS (`.greentext`, `.quote-link`, `.admin-thread-del-btn`, duplicate `.media-expanded`, `.media-rotate-btn`, `.thread-id-badge`, `.quote-block`, `.quote-toggle`, `.archive-heading`, `.autoupdate-bar`, `.video-player`). Fixed two undefined CSS variable references (`--font-mono` → `--font`, `--bg-body` → `--bg`). Merged duplicate `.file-container` block into a single declaration.
- **Database module split** — the 2,264-line monolithic `db.rs` has been reorganized into five focused modules with zero call-site changes (all existing `db::` references compile unchanged):
  - `mod.rs` (466 lines) — connection pool, shared types (`NewPost`, `CachedFile`), schema initialization, shared helpers
  - `boards.rs` (293 lines) — site settings, board CRUD, stats
  - `threads.rs` (333 lines) — thread listing, creation, mutation, archiving, pruning
  - `posts.rs` (642 lines) — post CRUD, file deduplication, polls, job queue, worker helpers
  - `admin.rs` (558 lines) — admin sessions, bans, word filters, reports, mod log, ban appeals, IP history, maintenance
- **Template module split** — the 2,736-line monolithic template file has been reorganized into five focused modules with no changes to the public API (all existing handler code works without modification):
  - `mod.rs` (392 lines) — shared infrastructure: site name/subtitle statics, base layout, pagination, timestamp formatting, utility helpers
  - `board.rs` (697 lines) — home page, board index, catalog, search, and archive rendering
  - `thread.rs` (738 lines) — thread view, post rendering, polls, and post edit form
  - `admin.rs` (760 lines) — login page, admin panel, mod log, VACUUM results, IP history
  - `forms.rs` (198 lines) — new thread and reply forms, shared across board and thread pages

### 🔒 Security Fixes

**Critical**
- **PoW bypass on replies** — proof-of-work verification was only enforced on new threads but not on replies. Replies now require a valid PoW nonce when the board has CAPTCHA enabled.
- **PoW nonce replay** — the same proof-of-work solution could be submitted repeatedly. Used nonces are now tracked in memory and rejected within their 5-minute validity window. Stale entries are automatically pruned.

**High**
- **Removed inline JavaScript** — all inline `<script>` blocks and `onclick`/`onchange`/`onsubmit` attributes have been extracted into external `.js` files. The Content Security Policy now uses `script-src 'self'` with no `unsafe-inline`, closing a major XSS surface.
- **Backup upload size cap** — the restore endpoints previously accepted uploads of unlimited size, risking out-of-memory crashes. Both full and board restore routes are now capped at 512 MiB.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Post rate limiting simplified** — removed the global `check_post_rate_limit` function that was silently overriding per-board cooldown settings. A board with `post_cooldown_secs = 0` now correctly means zero cooldown. The per-board setting is the sole post rate control.
- **API endpoints excluded from GET rate limit** — hover-preview requests (`/api/post/*`) were being counted against the navigational rate limit, causing false throttling on threads with many quote links. All `/api/` routes are now excluded alongside `/static/`, `/boards/`, and `/admin/`. The GET limiter now only covers page loads that a scraper would target (board index, catalog, archive, threads, search, home).
- **Trailing slash 404s** — several routes returned 404 when accessed with or without a trailing slash (board index, catalog, archive, thread pages, post editing). Added middleware to normalize trailing slashes so all URL variations resolve correctly. Bookmarks and manually typed URLs now work as expected.

## [1.0.11] — 2026-03-06

### 🔒 Security Fixes

**Critical**
- Added security headers (CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy) to block XSS and enforce HTTPS
- Fixed IP detection behind reverse proxies — bans and rate limits now actually work with nginx
- Added rate limiting to all read-only pages (60 req/min) to prevent denial-of-service
- Added zip-bomb protection on backup restore (max 1 GB per entry, max 50,000 entries)
- IP addresses are now hashed everywhere — raw IPs never appear in logs or memory
- Admin login now locks out after 5 failed attempts with increasing delays
- CSRF token comparison is now timing-safe to prevent token guessing
- Poll inputs now have size limits (10 options max, 128 chars each, 256-char question)

**High**
- Admin session cookies now expire properly instead of lasting forever
- Database connections now time out after 5 seconds instead of hanging forever under load
- Small endpoints (login, vote, report) now reject oversized requests at 64 KB instead of buffering 50 MB
- Fixed a redirect trick on logout that could send users to malicious sites via backslash URLs
- Report and appeal handlers now correctly detect IPs behind proxies
- Background workers now retry with smarter backoff instead of all hammering the database at once
- Fixed a race condition where two identical file uploads at the same time could cause a server error

- **Cross-board quote previews** — hovering `>>>/board/123` links now shows a floating preview popup
- **Floating "new replies" pill** — shows how many new posts arrived while you're reading; click to scroll down
- **Live thread metadata** — reply count, lock status, and sticky badges update in real time without refreshing
- **"(You)" badges** — your own posts are marked so you can easily spot replies to them
- **Spoiler text** — wrap text in `[spoiler]...[/spoiler]` to hide it until hover/click
